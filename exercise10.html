    <h1 id="abstract">Guitar</h1><hr>
    <p>The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that typically has six strings. It is held flat against the player's body and played by strumming or plucking the strings with the dominant hand, while simultaneously pressing selected strings against frets with the fingers of the opposite hand. A plectrum or individual finger picks may also be used to strike the strings.
      The sound of the guitar is projected either acoustically, by means of a resonant chamber on the instrument, or amplified by an electronic pickup and an amplifier.<br><br>The <b>guitar</b> is a
      <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_instrument" title="String instrument">string instrument</a>
       which is played by plucking the strings. The main parts of a guitar are the body, the fretboard, the headstock and the strings. Guitars are usually made from wood or plastic. 
      Their strings are made of steel or nylon.<br><br>

      The guitar originally had four courses of strings, three double, the top course single, 
      that ran from a violin-like pegbox to a tension <a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/bridge-music" title="bridge-music">bridge</a> glued to the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/soundboard" title="soundboard">soundboard</a>, or belly; the bridge thus sustained the direct pull of the strings.

      <h4>History</h4><hr>
      <p>
      From the 1930s, people started making and playing guitars that used electricity and <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier" title="sAmplifier">Amplifier</a> to control the loudness. These guitars, which are often used in <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music" title="Pop_music">pop music</a>, are called electric guitars. 
      They do not need to have a hollow body. This is because they do not use acoustics to amplify the sound. <br><br>From the 16th to the 19th century several changes occurred in the instrument. A fifth course of strings was added before 1600; by the late 18th century a sixth course was added. Before 1800 the double courses were replaced by single strings tuned E–A–D–G–B–E′, still the standard tuning.<br><br>
      The violin-type pegbox was replaced about 1600 by a flat, slightly reflexed head with rear tuning pegs; in the 19th century, metal screws were substituted for the tuning pegs. The early tied-on gut frets were replaced by built-on ivory or metal frets in the 18th century. The fingerboard was originally flush with and ended at the belly, and several metal or ivory frets were placed directly on the belly. In the 19th century the fingerboard was raised slightly above the level of the belly and was extended across it to the edge of the sound hole.<br><br>
      The 19th-century <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/plastic" title="innovations">innovations</a> were largely the work of Antonio Torres. The instrument that resulted was the classical guitar, which is strung with three gut and three metal-spun silk strings. Nylon or other <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/innovations" title="plastic">plastic</a> was later used in place of gut.</p><hr>

     <aside>
        <p>There are a lot more different guitar types than the usual acoustic and electric models that come to most people’s minds. The guitar has evolved in such a way that many different variations have been made.
